1. Initialize the data segment to store messages and string buffer.
2. Display the message "Enter a string:" (MSG1) using interrupt 21H.
3. Read the user input string:
   a. Initialize pointers `SI` and `DI` to point to the string buffer (STR1).
   b. Read each character until the user presses Enter (carriage return).
   c. Store each character in STR1.
4. Terminate the string by adding "$" at the end.
5. Start checking for palindrome:
   a. Set `DI` to the last character before "$".
   b. Compare characters from the beginning (`SI`) and end (`DI`).
   c. If characters match, increment `SI` and decrement `DI`.
   d. If characters don't match, print "It is not a palindrome." (MSG3).
6. If all characters match, print "It is a palindrome." (MSG2).
7. Exit the program using interrupt 21H with function `4CH`.
