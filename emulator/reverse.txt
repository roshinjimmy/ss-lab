1. Initialize data segment to access the string
2. Call REVERSE function:
   a. Set SI to the start of the string
   b. Set CX (counter) to 0
   c. Loop through the string:
      i. Push each character onto the stack
      ii. Increment the pointer SI
      iii. Increment CX
   d. When '$' is encountered, exit loop
3. Set SI back to the start of the string
4. Loop through the string to pop characters from the stack:
   a. Pop character from the stack into DX
   b. Clear the upper byte of DX (XOR DH, DH)
   c. Store the character back at the current position in the string
   d. Increment SI and decrement CX
5. Once the string is reversed, append '$' to terminate the string
6. Return control to the main program
7. Print the reversed string
8. Exit the program
