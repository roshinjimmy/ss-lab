Start
Initialize data segment.
Load the number to be checked into AL.
If the number is less than 2, jump to not_prime.
Set divisor BL to 2.
Check Divisibility Loop:
Set the quotient in AL and remainder in AH by dividing the number (AL) by BL.
If remainder (AH) is 0, the number is divisible by BL, so jump to not_prime.
Calculate BL * BL and store the result in BX.
If BL * BL is greater than the number, jump to prime.
Increment BL and repeat the divisibility check.
Not Prime:
Print "The number is not prime."
End the program.
Prime:
Print "The number is prime."
End the program
