Initialize Data Segment:

Load the data segment to the DS register.
Define an array arr[] containing the numbers to be processed (in this case, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 9).
Set the size of the array (size) to 7 (the actual number of elements in arr[]).
Initialize Registers:

Set SI to point to the address of the array arr[].
Set CL to the value of size (the number of elements in the array).
Set BL to 0, which will be used to store the count of even numbers.
Iterate Over the Array:

Loop through each element in the array, comparing the value to determine if it is even or odd.
For each element:
Load the current element from arr[] into register AL.
Test the least significant bit (LSB) of AL using the test instruction. If the LSB is 0, the number is even.
If the number is even (i.e., AL & 1 == 0), increment BL (to count the even numbers).
Check Loop Condition:

After processing each element:
Decrement the size counter CL.
If CL becomes 0, exit the loop as all elements have been processed.
Print the Result:

After the loop ends, print the message "Number of even numbers is:" using the DOS interrupt int 21h with function 09h.
Convert the value in BL (the count of even numbers) to its ASCII equivalent by adding '0' to it.
Store the ASCII value in the buffer and print it using int 21h.
Terminate the Program:

Use the int 21h with function 4Ch to exit the program.
