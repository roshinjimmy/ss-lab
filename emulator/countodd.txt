Set the data segment to point to data.
Load the size of the array (size) into register CL.
Load the address of the array (arr) into register SI.
Set register BL (odd number count) to 0.
Compare the value of CL (remaining elements) with 0. If CL is 0, jump to the print step.
Load the current element of the array into register AL.
Check if the least significant bit (LSB) of AL is 1 (i.e., check if the number is odd) using the test instruction:
If the number is odd, increment the BL register (odd count).
Move to the next element in the array by incrementing SI.
Decrement CL to track the remaining number of elements.
Repeat the loop until all elements are checked.
Load the address of the message msg1 into DX and display the message using DOS interrupt 21h.
Move the odd count from BL to AL.
Convert the count into its ASCII representation by adding '0' to AL.
Store the result in the buffer.
Load the address of the buffer containing the odd count and display it using DOS interrupt 21h.
Terminate the program using DOS interrupt 21h with function 4Ch.
